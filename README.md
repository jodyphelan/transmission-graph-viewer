# transmission-graph-viewer

Visit [the website](https://jodyphelan.github.io/transmission-graph-viewer) to visualise the graph output from `tb-profiler`.

After running `tb-profiler collate`, you will get a file ending with .transmission_graph.json. Drag and drop this file to the upload box to the left and see the graph. You can use the simple controls to colour the nodes based on drug resistance or lineage. You can also display labels. To select nodes for download, use the `cmd/ctrl` key and click and drag and hit the download button. 

No data is uploaded anywhere, all data is process and visualised in your browser and stays on your computer. To show funders our software is used we do monitor the total number of page views, but no personal data is collected. This is facilitated through [Simple Analytics](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/your-privacy-policy).
